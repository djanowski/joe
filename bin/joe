JOE(1)

NAME
       joe -- Release your gems, no pain involved.

SYNOPSIS
       joe COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       Joe is a small script that helps you build and release Ruby gems. It only
       needs a gemspec file or an ERB gemspec template. With joe you can build the
       gem, install it, archive it and release it to rubygems.org.

USAGE
       Joe assumes you have a *.gemspec file in the current directory and it will
       use it to build the gem. If you prefer to use an ERB template, make sure
       you have the template named *.gemspec.erb.

COMMANDS
       help        Show this usage guide
       gemspec     Generate the gemspec file out of the ERB template
       build       Build the gem
       install     Build the gem, package it, and install it
       archive     Create a .tar.gz archive out of the current HEAD
       release     Push gem to rubygems.org

EXAMPLES
       If your library is called foo, you need to have foo.gemspec or
       foo.gemspec.erb available. If you do, the following command will build the
       gem and release it to rubygems.org.

           joe release

       To install the gem locally without releasing it:

           joe install
